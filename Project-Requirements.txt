# Smart Irrigation System: Project Requirements

## 1. Introduction

The **Smart Irrigation System** is an automated system that helps control the watering of plants based on real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels. The system is designed to optimize the irrigation process by ensuring that plants receive water only when needed. The system is controlled remotely via the **Blynk mobile app**.

## 2. Hardware Requirements

### ESP32 Development Board
- **Role:** Handles Wi-Fi connectivity, data collection from sensors, and communication with the Blynk app.

### DHT11/DHT22 Sensor
- **Role:** Measures environmental temperature and humidity levels.
- **Note:** The **DHT22** is more accurate and has a wider range compared to the **DHT11**.

### Soil Moisture Sensor
- **Role:** Measures the soil moisture level to determine when to activate the irrigation system.

### Relay Module
- **Role:** Controls the water pump. The relay switches the water pump on/off based on the moisture levels of the soil.

### Water Pump
- **Role:** Waters the plants when moisture levels are low and irrigation is required.

### RGB LED Strip (Optional)
- **Role:** Provides visual feedback on the system's status (e.g., on/off, normal operation, or error).

### Jumper Wires
- **Role:** Used to connect all components to the ESP32 development board.

### Breadboard (Optional)
- **Role:** Used for prototyping and connecting components without soldering.

### Power Supply
- **Role:** Provides the necessary power for the ESP32 and water pump.

## 3. Software Requirements

### Arduino IDE
- **Role:** The development environment for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the ESP32 development board.

### Blynk App (Mobile Application)
- **Role:** Allows users to control and monitor the Smart Irrigation System remotely. You will need to create a Blynk account and set up the project in the app.

### Libraries
- **Blynk:** For remote control of the system via the Blynk app.
- **DHT Sensor Library:** For reading data from the DHT11/DHT22 sensor.
- **FastLED:** For controlling the RGB LED strip (if used).
- **WiFi:** For enabling Wi-Fi functionality on the ESP32.
- **ESP32 Board Library:** To program and upload code to the ESP32 development board.

> **Note:** All required libraries should be installed via the **Arduino IDE Library Manager**.

## 4. Setup Instructions

### 4.1 Hardware Setup
1. Connect the **DHT sensor**, **soil moisture sensor**, and **relay module** to the ESP32.
2. Ensure that the **water pump** is connected through the relay to the ESP32.
3. (Optional) Set up the **RGB LED strip** for visual feedback.
4. Power the system using an appropriate **power supply**.

### 4.2 Software Setup
1. Install the necessary libraries in the **Arduino IDE** (Blynk, DHT, FastLED, WiFi).
2. Clone or download the source code from the **GitHub repository**.
3. Open the code in **Arduino IDE** and configure your **Blynk Template ID**, **Template Name**, and **Authentication Token** in the code.
4. Upload the code to the **ESP32**.
5. Connect your mobile device to the **Blynk app** and configure it to interact with the system.
6. Monitor the systemâ€™s performance and control the irrigation remotely via the app.

## 5. Features

- **Automatic Irrigation:** The system automatically turns the water pump on or off based on soil moisture levels.
- **Remote Control:** Control and monitor the irrigation system from anywhere using the **Blynk app**.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** View temperature, humidity, and moisture levels in real-time via the app.

## 6. Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Weather API:** Integrate with weather services to predict weather forecasts and optimize irrigation schedules, preventing over-watering.
- **Data Logging:** Log data such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture for future analysis and optimization.
- **Battery-Powered Option:** Convert the system to use solar power for off-grid irrigation.
